# Wine Launcher
Ultra minimalist way to launch Windows software (.exe) from Linux. Useful for gaming, i guess.

Written in C, for the world to see.

üç∑ Wine (the alcoholic drink) is unhealthy in real life.

### Dependencies
Better make sure to hit up `sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev` for the `source-gtk-gnome.c` version. (More versions coming ~~soon~~ later)

### Compilation
Easy-peasy, lemon squeezy.

```
gcc `pkg-config --cflags gtk+-3.0` -o OUTPUT SOURCE `pkg-config --libs gtk+-3.0`
```
Ignore errors like this:

### Execution
Just find the .exe file and run!

Terrible concept, I know. But who cares?
